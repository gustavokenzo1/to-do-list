## About

This repository was made to store code from a React challenge, where we had to develop a "To-Do List" application.

I don't know why I am writing this README in english, I just realized the whole app was written in portuguÃªs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
